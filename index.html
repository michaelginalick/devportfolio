                            This is a side project that attemps to capture all the events going on around Chicago.
                            It's built with VueJS, Golang and deployed to AWS. The calendar interface is a custom calendar that communicates with a RESTFUL API.
                            The server can injest a CSV creating single and multiday events. I had been wanting to build something with Go for awhile and it was great experience.
                            To enhance my front end skills I opted to make the calendar from scratch.

                            A command line tool made with Golang. With it you can track your pomodoro sessions while at work or studying.
                            You can enter the number of minutes you'd like to concentrate for, up to one hour, and it'll count down the remaining time.
                            This will enable you to not be distracted and wondering how much time you have left.
                            Ideally you can concentrate on the task at hand until the clock hits 0:00.

                        <p>
                            A desktop Java application that was the final project in CS6310 – Software Architecture & Design.
                            The application was developed over the semester and was iterated upon many times.
                            Starting from a simple command line tool and a few classes we added a user interface via JavaFx and many more classes.
                            The program evolved into a multithreaded application where users can choose between manual and automated game play.
                            Accompanying the program was full UML documentation including sequence and deploy diagrams.
                            It's worth mentioning that due to academic policy at Georgia Tech I am unable to post source code on a publicly accessible repository.

                        <p>
                            A Ruby library to assist with parsing SAML XML metadata payloads.
                            If you manage many SAML providers this tool will automatically parse the XML of each provider.
                            I built this library to parse the payload as well as generate the X509 certificate based on the digest algorithm passed in.
                            You can use this library as a simple command line tool or bundle it into your Rails application.
